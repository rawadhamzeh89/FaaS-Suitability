-the package parsing contains all the classes for parsing the java code.
-the package staticComplexity.the analysis contains the classes for calculating the code complexity. Since the codeMR algorithm can't be invoked by code, so I  decided to get the generated code as a json file.
-the package Evaluation contains the classes for evaluating the code.
- the code start from Parsing package.
the CodeMR.json, CodeMR.json, FaaSUseCase.json data files should be published into DBmongo database.
